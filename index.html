                        I've developed a recipe site with ASP.NET. Then I build the database with
                        MSSQL. I created the necessary tables in SQL and established the relationships
                        between them. I generated a ASP.NET empty web site. I created a web form
                        and added CSS. I generated the structure of the website with a master page. I
                        created the menu and web forms. I generated a class for connection with SQL.
                        Records can be updated from the admin page.
